# 🌉 Bison Bridges – Recycled Plastic Bridges Built to Last

At **Bison Bridges**, we specialise in the supply of **recycled plastic bridges** designed for strength, durability, and sustainability. Made from **Re-Life solid grade recycled plastic**, our bridges are engineered for performance — especially in **humid or wet environments** where traditional timber would degrade.

## 🌿 Why Choose Recycled Plastic?

Bridges are often exposed to moisture, making traditional timber vulnerable to rot, warping, and decay. Our **recycled plastic material** is:

- Weather-resistant and rot-proof  
- Maintenance-free and long-lasting  
- Environmentally responsible  
- UV-stable and non-toxic  

Ideal for parks, trails, reserves, and rural estates — these bridges provide a **cost-effective, durable alternative** to timber.

## 💪 Proven Structural Strength

- ✅ **5.0kN/m² crowd loading** – suitable for pedestrian & cycle use  
- ✅ **7.0kN point loading** – ideal for bridleway bridges  
- ✅ High load capacity with a lightweight structure  
- ✅ Extended service life with minimal upkeep  

These features make **Bison recycled plastic bridges** the ideal solution for high-traffic and exposed outdoor locations.
